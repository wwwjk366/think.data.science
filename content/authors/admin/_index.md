"You can have data without information, but you cannot have information without data."

I'm an accomplished data scientist and thought leader with 8+ years of experience of research and bring to market advance analytics and machine learning solutions. I have been extremely lucky to work in many different realms, including retail, finance, marketing and even gaming. I like data. Manipulating it, modeling it, making it (simulation), visualizing it and yes, even cleaning it. Also as a person with insatiable intellectual curiosity, I am passionate about finding actionable insights hidden in vast amounts of raw data.
