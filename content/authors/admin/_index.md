"You can have data without information, but you cannot have information without data."

I'm a seasoned data scientist with 8 years of experience of machine learning and predictive modeling in finance, gaming and retail industries. I'm also a person with insatiable intellectual curiosity who is passionate about finding actionable insights hidden in vast amounts of raw data.
