"You can have data without information, but you cannot have information without data."

I'm an accomplished data scientist and thought leader with 10+ years of experience of research and bring to market advance analytics and machine learning solutions. As a person with insatiable intellectual curiosity, I am passionate about finding actionable insights hidden in vast amounts of raw data. I like data. Manipulating it, making it (simulation),  modeling it, visualizing it and yes, even cleaning it. I have been extremely lucky to work in many different realms --- I have built gambling market trading algorithms and live spots models for online sportsbook. I have built DSaaS tools housing customer analytics and recommendation engine for enterprise customers. I have built quantitative portfolio construction algorithms for PE firm. Now I am working with a team of excellent engineers to help people park their cars using cellphone app.
