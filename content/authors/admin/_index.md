"You can have data without information, but you cannot have information without data."

I'm an accomplished data scientist and thought leader with 12+ years of experience in research and bring to market machine learning and AI products. As a person with insatiable intellectual curiosity, I am passionate about finding actionable insights hidden in vast amounts of raw data. I like data. Manipulating it, making it (simulation),  modeling it, visualizing it and yes, even cleaning it. I have been extremely lucky to work in many different realms --- I have built dynamic pricing algorithms for the largest online parking marketplace Patent pending). I have built gambling market trading algorithms and live sports models for an online sportsbook. I have built DSaaS tools housing customer analytics and recommendation engine for enterprise customers. I have built quantitative portfolio construction algorithms for PE firm. Now I'm leading and building a world-class data science team at Mistplay, the #1 loyalty platform for mobile gamers.
