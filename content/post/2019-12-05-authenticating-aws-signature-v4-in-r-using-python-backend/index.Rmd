## Intuition 

I was working with an Elasticsearch project on AWS using Python and the `requests_aws4auth` package worked like a charm for me. Never had any issue regarding the authentication (AWS V4 could be hard to work with sometimes). However, when I trying to create a Shiny app for my project, the problem emerged. I just couldn't get the V4 auth to work with `httr` in R. I tried `aws.signature` package on [Github](https://github.com/cloudyr/aws.signature) but keep getting request header issues. Then I remembered that JJ Alaire from Rstudio created this amazing package `reticulate` [(link)](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) claiming the ability to import Python packages into R. Therefore I am intrigued to give it a try!

## The Syntax

After install this package, the actually syntax is quite simple.

Load the package and point it to the location of your Python (I'm using Ubuntu here):

```{r}
library(reticulate)
use_python("/usr/local/bin/python")
```

Then you can easily load and call Python functions! For example, a simple `listdir` function from  `os` package:

```{r}
os <- import("os")
os$listdir(".")
```

## In Shiny

All I did was adding those to the `global.R` script (the script I source first in `server.R`)

```r
py_awsauth <- import("requests_aws4auth")
py_requests <- import("requests")

region <- 'us-east-2'
service <- 'execute-api'
credentials <- aws.signature::locate_credentials()
authr <- py_awsauth$AWS4Auth(credentials$key, credentials$secret, region, service, session_token=credentials$session_token)
url <- 'https://.....'

```
As you can see I am setting up the AWS connection using my local stored credentials. And the next step is to send HTTP request using Python `requests` package.

One thing to noticed is that you cannot use nested list for your payload as you would do that if you are using R `httr` package. You have to create a Python dictionary object as your payload using `reticulate::py_dict()` function:

```r

params <- reticulate::py_dict(c("x", "y"),
                              c(...,...))
response <- py_requests$get(url, auth = authr,params = params)
res <- response$json()
```

It worked like magic!

## Thoughts

This is a good example of why I always encouraging Data Scientist to learn both R and Python. Many people only proficient in one and often has biased opinion against the other. Why not learn both so you can use the amazing package in R like `shiny` and equivalently amazing packages like `ortools` (I will write another post on this) at the same time!
